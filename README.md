**About the Author - **
I'm **Kuhu Bhatnagar** (aka **aSagCoder**), a 3rd Year Comp Sci Engineering student. I am currently exploring three fields mainly - Data Science, Web Development and Gaming Development. I hope to release and create more projects and aspire to become an author and a game dev someday. As a Comp Sci student, I am trying to learn new programming languages and develop simple yet innovative projects in order to increase my problem-solving skills and clear out my doubts and concepts. 

**Project Description - **
**Project Name -** Sudoku Solver
**Programming Language -** Python 

**FAQs - **

**Q - What is Sudoku?**
**A -** Sudoku is a very popular, logic-based puzzle game and has many variations to it. In the classic version of Sudoku, the goal is to fill a 9x9 

**Q - What does the program does?**
**A -** This project is written as a way to solve any and all possible combinations of classic Sudoku puzzles. I will be soon releasing a document that will explain in detail how the code works and what element/concepts have been used in the code. 

**Q - Why Sudoku?**
**A -** As a teen, one of the few things me and my grandparents connected over, despite the generational gap, was Sudoku. I would visit them for the summer and on days when it was too hot to go outside and travel, we would each pull out a sudoku puzzle on a sudoku book or on phones and immerse ourselves into it, solving as many puzzles as we can. While I am not a Sudoku Master, I do aspire to compete professionally someday and looking back at this puzzle brings back fond memories. This made me think that perhaps a project on it would be very apt for me to learn and execute.
